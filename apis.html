							<h4>The Daily Bugle</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-7">
							<p class="description">
								The Daily Bugle was founded in 1898 and has been published daily ever since. The Daily Bugle is printed in tabloid format like its rival The Daily Globe. The editor and publisher of the Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson, began his journalistic career as a reporter for the Bugle while still in high school. Jameson purchased the then-floundering Bugle with inheritance funds, from his recently deceased father-in-law and turned the paper into a popular success. Other magazines published from time-to-time include the revived Now magazine and the now-defunct Woman magazine, edited by Carol Danvers.

							<h4>Duff</h4>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-7">
							<p class="description">
								Some have speculated that the name was inspired by one-syllable beer names in the United States (such as "Bud"), and The Simpsons' writers had found the name humorous.[3] However, longtime Simpsons animator, producer, and director David Silverman has stated that Groening named the beer "Duff" simply for the convenient rhyme in the slogan "Can't Get Enough of that Wonderful Duff".[4]
								In an excerpt from his autobiography, former Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan claimed that the beer was named after him as the writers were fans of the band and he was known for his extreme alcohol consumption.[5] This is a claim Simpsons creator Matt Groening has called "absurd".[6]
